How a Firewall Filters Traffic – Summary
A firewall acts as a security gatekeeper that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. It decides whether to allow or block traffic by examining packet details such as:

Source IP address – where the traffic is coming from

Destination IP address – where the traffic is going

Protocol type – e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP

Port number – identifies the specific service (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)

Filtering Methods:
Packet Filtering – Checks headers of packets against rules; simple and fast.

Stateful Inspection – Tracks active connections and allows only valid packets that match existing sessions.

Application Layer Filtering – Analyzes data inside packets for specific applications (e.g., blocking certain websites or file types).

Function in Practice:
Inbound filtering: Blocks unwanted traffic from entering the system, reducing the risk of attacks.

Outbound filtering: Controls what data can leave the system, preventing unauthorized transmissions.

In our  task:
Blocking port 23 stopped Telnet traffic from entering.

Allowing port 22 ensured SSH connections remained possible.
